SUBJECT : SNTSDEV Topic Consultation
CONTENT :
Good evening sir, we are currently making progress in researching information for our topics “Biometrics : Fingerprint Authentication / Touch-Sensitive Display in Smartphones to people with Palmar Hyperhidrosis (Sweaty Palms) in Metro Manila” and “E-Commerce : The Impact of the Internet to Carousel/Shopee PH Entrepreneurs to Increase Profit and Growth” in order to support our titles for our title defense. We still need to have a 3rd topic for backup and we would like to hear your thoughts about it, details are listed below
                Title : “A Summative Evaluation of the Implementation of Self-Checkout Machines in a Third World Country Setting”
                Target Audience : Third World Country (specifically the Philippines) Groceries, Supermarkets and Hypermarkets
                Description : A study regarding the implementation of self checkout machines in groceries or supermarkets within third world countries. If it is compatible in a third world country setting? If it can be of big help when it comes to extremely long lines in groceries? The main purpose is to help grocery, supermarket and hypermarket owners to decide whether to implement the said machines.

*If the target audience is still too big, we are willing to change it and make the target local.

Thank you.
