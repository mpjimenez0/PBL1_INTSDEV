Rationale: *why this topic? (2-3 paragraphs)
    >> to find possible __ to help the retail industry in the Philippines
    >> In the Philippines, there are extremely long lines especially in the Grocery Stores and because of that, we wanted to find a way to reduce the waiting time in lines queues, and as Computer Science students, we wanted to solve this problem in a techy and modern way. Self Checkout Machines are the (customers POV)

      content: The self checkout machines are indeed useful still, there are encountered problems such as the barcode not scanning well, as well as the customers pace in making a transaction. 20 students and 39 non-students (a total of 59) answered a survey regarding self-checkout systems. Outputs of the survey focused on the problems encountered while using the said machines. The researcher also provided and suggested possible solutions to the problems stated by the customers. As the researcher concluded the research, he stated that the sample is small thus making it hard to observe any real statistical difference between the student and non student group.
