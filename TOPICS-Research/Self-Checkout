Title: A Summative Evaluation of the Implementation of Self-Checkout Machines in the Philippines
Keywords: Self-Check out Machines, Summative Evaluation
Short Title: Self-Checkout Machines in the Philippines
Rationale: *why this topic? (2-3 paragraphs)
    >> In the Philippines, there are extremely long lines especially in the Grocery Stores and because of that, we wanted to find a way to reduce the waiting time in lines queues, and as Computer Science students, we wanted to solve this problem in a techy and modern way. Self-Checkout Machines are the (customers POV)
    >> Committing human errors is inevitable, and existing cashiers cannot prevent this. By implementing self-checkout system in grocery stores, hypermarket, and supermarket we can reduce these errors.
    Wanted to reduce human error(>> wala nang pinapasahod na empleyado, innovations para sa business)
    malaking grocery, SNR >> kung pwede, if the businesses in the Philippines
    >> Due to the high theft rate in the philippines,
    We wanted to provide possible innovations for the retail industry such as Hypermarkets, Supermarkets, and Groceries.

      source: http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/154193120705101703
      content: The Self-Checkout machines are indeed useful still, there are encountered problems such as the barcode not scanning well, as well as the customers pace in making a transaction. 20 students and 39 non-students (a total of 59) answered a survey regarding self-checkout systems. Outputs of the survey focused on the problems encountered while using the said machines. The researcher also provided and suggested possible solutions to the problems stated by the customers. As the researcher concluded the research, he stated that the sample is small thus making it hard to observe any real statistical difference between the student and non student group.
