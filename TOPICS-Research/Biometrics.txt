Biometrics : Fingerprint Authentication / Touch-Sensitive Display in Smartphones to people with Palmar Hyperhidrosis(Sweaty Palms) in Metro Manila

Target Audience : Metro Manila Residents with Palmar Hyperhidrosis that owns a Smartphone

Problem : "How would people with Palmar Hyperhidrosis utilize the functions of their smartphones namely the FINGERPRINT AUTHENTICATION and the TOUCH-SENSITIVE DISPLAY?" >> afterwards, effects and reasons
          ** What are the disadvantages of having Palmar Hyperhidrosis in using Smartphones with fingerprint authentication and touch sensitive display
          "general : Why does the fingerprint authentication feature doesn't accurately detect the fingerprint of the user."
          -- addtl info "How does the phone detect if the finger is wet upon using the fingerprint feature."
          -- addtl info "What is the cause of Palmar Hyperhidrosis?"
          -- addtl info "physically, does the scratches from the button affect the recognition of fingerprints"
          "Can the phone be unlocked even though the registered finger is wet?"
          "Why do "

Additional Info
 > Waterproof / Water Resistant phones >> they have to work properly when fully submerged in water because it defeats the purpose of the phone being Waterproof / Water Resistant
 > Will guide the Latest Trend in Smartphones wherein they are Water and Dust Resistant

Main Goal:
  --> To study the user experience of people with Palmar Hyperhidrosis with their Smartphones

 TOTAL: lahat may palmar hyperhidrosis

      source : https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3192878_Fingerprint_Image_Enhancement_Algorithm_and_Performance_Evaluation
      content : The researcher here described what Fingerprint Identification is, the researcher also analyzed the algorithm used in enhancing the fingerprint scanned, transforming it to a higher quality image thus making it more unique. Also, they analyzed and described how the fingerprint identification itself works. The researcher experimented on scanning different fingerprints and used a Goodness index of the fingerprints before and after going through the Enhancement.
