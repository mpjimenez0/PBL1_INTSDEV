Biometrics : Fingerprint Authentication / Touch-Sensitive Display in Smartphones to people with Palmar Hyperhidrosis(Sweaty Palms) in Metro Manila

Target Audience : Metro Manila Residents with Palmar Hyperhidrosis that owns a Smartphone

Problem : "How would people with Palmar Hyperhidrosis utilize the functions of their smartphones namely the FINGERPRINT AUTHENTICATION and the TOUCH-SENSITIVE DISPLAY" >> afterwards, effects and reasons
          "general : Why does the fingerprint authentication feature doesn't accurately detect the fingerprint of the user."
          -- addtl info "How does the phone detect if the finger is wet upon using the fingerprint feature."
          -- addtl info "What is the cause of Palmar Hyperhidrosis?"
          -- addtl info "physically, does the scratches from the button affect the recognition of fingerprints"
          "Can the phone be unlocked even though the registered finger is wet?"

Additional Info
 > Waterproof / Water Resistant phones >> they have to work properly when fully submerged in water because it defeats the purpose of the phone being Waterproof / Water Resistant
 > Will guide the Latest Trend in Smartphones wherein they are Water and Dust Resistant
