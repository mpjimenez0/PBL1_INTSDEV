Biometrics : Fingerprint Authentication / Touch-Sensitive Display in Smartphones to people with Palmar Hyperhidrosis(Sweaty Palms) in Metro Manila

Target Audience : Metro Manila Residents with Palmar Hyperhidrosis that owns a Smartphone

Problem : "How would people with Palmar Hyperhidrosis utilize the functions of their smartphones namely the FINGERPRINT AUTHENTICATION and the TOUCH-SENSITIVE DISPLAY?" >> afterwards, effects and reasons
          ** What are the disadvantages of having Palmar Hyperhidrosis in using Smartphones with fingerprint authentication and touch sensitive display
          "general : Why does the fingerprint authentication feature doesn't accurately detect the fingerprint of the user."
          -- addtl info "How does the phone detect if the finger is wet upon using the fingerprint feature."
          -- addtl info "What is the cause of Palmar Hyperhidrosis?"
          -- addtl info "physically, does the scratches from the button affect the recognition of fingerprints"
          "Can the phone be unlocked even though the registered finger is wet?"
          "Why do "

Additional Info
 > Waterproof / Water Resistant phones >> they have to work properly when fully submerged in water because it defeats the purpose of the phone being Waterproof / Water Resistant
 > Will guide the Latest Trend in Smartphones wherein they are Water and Dust Resistant

Main Goal:
  --> To study the user experience of people with Palmar Hyperhidrosis with their Smartphones

Title: Biometrics : Fingerprint Authentication / Touch-Sensitive Display in Smartphones to people with Palmar Hyperhidrosis(Sweaty Palms) in Metro Manila
Keywords: Palmar Hyperhidrosis, Biometrics (Fingerprint Authentication), Smartphones
Short Title: The use of Smartphones to people with Sweaty Palms
Rationale: *why this topic? (2-3 paragraphs)
    >> The current trend in smartphones, the Fingerprint Authentication, this feature dramatically increased the level of security that one phone has, but another current trend in smartphones namely Water Resistance somehow revealed the flaws of the Fingerprint Authentication.
    >> One of the researchers (who has Palmar Hyperhidrosis) experience the everyday struggles of using a Smartphone, specifically the Smartphones Touch Sensitive Display. The contradicting concept of a Water Resistant Smartphone that doesn't function well when wet sparked this idea.

      content : The researcher here described what Fingerprint Identification is, the researcher also analyzed the algorithm used in enhancing the fingerprint scanned, transforming it to a higher quality image thus making it more unique. Also, they analyzed and described how the fingerprint identification itself works. The researcher experimented on scanning different fingerprints and used a Goodness index of the fingerprints before and after going through the Enhancement.
