Biometrics : Fingerprint Authentication / Touch-Sensitive Display in Smartphones to people with Palmar Hyperhidrosis(Sweaty Palms) in Metro Manila

Target Audience : Metro Manila Residents with Palmar Hyperhidrosis that owns a Smartphone

Problem : "How would people with Palmar Hyperhidrosis utilize the functions of their smartphones namely the FINGERPRINT AUTHENTICATION and the TOUCH-SENSITIVE DISPLAY?" >> afterwards, effects and reasons
          ** What are the disadvantages of having Palmar Hyperhidrosis in using Smartphones with fingerprint authentication and touch sensitive display
          "general : Why does the fingerprint authentication feature doesn't accurately detect the fingerprint of the user."
          -- addtl info "How does the phone detect if the finger is wet upon using the fingerprint feature."
          -- addtl info "What is the cause of Palmar Hyperhidrosis?"
          -- addtl info "physically, does the scratches from the button affect the recognition of fingerprints"
          "Can the phone be unlocked even though the registered finger is wet?"
          "Why do "

Additional Info
 > Waterproof / Water Resistant phones >> they have to work properly when fully submerged in water because it defeats the purpose of the phone being Waterproof / Water Resistant
 > Will guide the Latest Trend in Smartphones wherein they are Water and Dust Resistant

Main Goal:
  --> To study the user experience of people with Palmar Hyperhidrosis with their Smartphones

  Title: Biometrics : Fingerprint Authentication / Touch-Sensitive Display in Smartphones to people with Palmar Hyperhidrosis(Sweaty Palms) in Metro Manila
Keywords: Palmar Hyperhidrosis, Biometrics (Fingerprint Authentication) in Smartphones, Touch-Sensitive Display in Smartphones
Short Title: The use of Smartphones to people with Sweaty Palms
Rationale: *why this topic? (2-3 paragraphs)
    >> One of the researchers (who is self diagnosed with Palmar Hyperhidrosis) experience the everyday struggles of using a Smartphone, specifically the Smartphones Touch Sensitive Display. Also, the existence of Waterproof and Water Resistant Smartphones in the Market that doesn't function well when wet sparked this idea. We researchers wanted to analyze the User Experience of people with Palmar Hyperhidrosis while using their smartphones. (P.O.V. of the Researcher / Palmar Hyperhidrosis Affected Individual)
    >> The current trend in smartphones, Fingerprint Authentication  dramatically increased the level of security that one phone has, but another current trend in smartphones namely Water Resistance somehow revealed the flaws of the Fingerprint Authentication.  (P.O.V. of the System)

Background of the Study:
    Smartphones are hand held devices that functions like a computer. They can receive and make calls, create and receive messages, also, these smartphones has the capability to connect to the internet, making them capable of downloading and running 3rd party apps (downloaded from digital distribution platforms such as Google Play and App Store). Smartphones are first introduced in 1999 by the japanese company NTT DoCoMo, and became widespread a year after. A lot of firms have been competing in the Smartphone Industry, and the competition never stops, every year, new features and innovations were introduced.
Research Questions:
    >> "How would people with Palmar Hyperhidrosis utilize the functions of their smartphones namely the FINGERPRINT AUTHENTICATION and the TOUCH-SENSITIVE DISPLAY?"
Theoretical & Conceptual Framework:
  *TF - 5 Theories of Keywords + Definition
  *CF - Diagram of the TFs
    -> Palmar Hyperhidrosis
      - Disproved Theories
          = "Excessive sweating occurs when feeling stressed, embarrassed, and scared. "
      - NOT YET Proved Theories
          = "Experiencing excessive sweating is linked to Genetics, Puberty, and Menopause"
      - Accepted Theories
        source: http://medind.nic.in/maa/t00/i1/maat00i1p27.pdf
      = Electric Gradient Theory **
        -iontophoresis disturbed the normal movement of sweat along the sweat duct which flows due to ionic gradient.
      = Plug Theory **
        - sweating inhibited through mechanical bloackage of sweat at the level of the stratum corneum, the depth and severity of obstruction being dose related.
      = CREB Protein Mutation is the cause of Hyperhidrosis
        - Dephosphorylation of CREB Accelerates at times of stress.
      =
    -> Fingerprint Authentication in Smartphones
    -> Touch-Sensitive Display in Smartphones

Definition of Terms:
  - Palmar Hyperhidrosis
    > The condition of excessive and uncontrollable sweating of the hands (palms)
  - Smartphone
    > A handheld device with the capabilities of functioning like a computer

Methodology
  - Research Design
    > This is a Descriptive Research regarding the User Experience of people with Sweaty Hands when using their smartphones
  - Respondents of the Study
    > The Respondents of this Study are people with Sweaty Hands and Smartphones that reside within Metro Manila
  - Research Instruments
    > Testing via Iodine Test
    > Questionnaire for Palmar Hyperhidrosis
    > Interviewing the respondents
  - Procedure
    https://www.sedl.org/cbam/stages_of_concern.html
    > We will first look for respondents (people with sweaty hands and smartphones that reside within Metro Manila) and we will let them answer a questionnaire, 70% - 40% of the sample will be interviewed and iodine tested.

Also, they analyzed and described how the fingerprint identification itself works. The researcher experimented on scanning different fingerprints and used a Goodness index of the fingerprints before and after going through the Enhancement.

        self diagnosis of hyperhidrosis
          "First, says Glaser, ask yourself if you have experienced focal visible excess sweat for at least six months without apparent cause. If the answer is "yes," then the next step is determining whether you meet at least two of the following criteria:

            > Your sweat is bilateral and relatively symmetrical, meaning you sweat the same on both sides of your body.
            > Your excess sweat impairs your daily activities.
            > You experience at least one episode a week.
            > The onset of your excess sweat is earlier than age 25.
            > You have a positive family history. (Meaning that other members   of your family suffer from similar sweating problems.)
            > You stop sweating when you're sleeping.

          If you meet at least two of the above criteria, chances are you have primary focal hyperhidrosis, and you should make an appointment with a dermatologist familiar with treatment options for people with hyperhidrosis. (Check our Physician Finder database for a doctor near you.) Some dermatologists believe upwards of 90 percent of people who present with excessive sweating will be diagnosed with primary hyperhidrosis."
